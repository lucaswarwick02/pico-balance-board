# Pico Balance Board
Using the motion tracking capabilites from the ICM-20948 in addition to the Maker Pi Board to detect imbalance.
## To build and compile project
For building and running the project, there are a few things which need to be done beforehand. Firstly, your Pico must be running CircuitPython (I have provided the links which I used for this in the below section). In addition, you will need the libraries (located inside the lib folder) to be added to your Pico's lib folder. From there, you can drop .py files in to the Pico and they should (hopefully) run using Thonny.
