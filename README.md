# Pico Balance Board
Using the motion tracking capabilites from the ICM-20948 in addition to the Maker Pi Board to detect imbalance.
## C
Inside the C folder are the required C and cmake files needed (as well as the corresponding libraries) to create the balance board. This project is labelled as Medium, as the C code required to use the ICM as well as the display are more complex than MicroPython.
## Circuit Python
Inside the CircuitPython folder is the required CircuitPython file as well as the required libraries. This challenge is labelled as Easy, as the code is simpler to use, in addition to only using the Maker Board's RGB LED, instead of the M4L's display screen.
